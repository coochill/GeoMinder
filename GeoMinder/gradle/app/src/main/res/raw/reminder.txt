To make sure **GeoMinder** works seamlessly:

For best results, enable High Accuracy Mode on your device.
Keep the app running in the background for timely notifications.




🔑 *Grant Necessary Permissions*
Allow GeoMinder to access your location “All the Time” for optimal performance.
Enable notification permissions to receive reminders without interruptions.
